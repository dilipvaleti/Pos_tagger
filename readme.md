# Simple English part-of-speech tagger

In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its contextâ€”i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. [Wikipedia]

Written in Python 3. Dependencies: `scipy`, `numpy`, `nltk`.   
_NB. all of the above dependencies are not crucial, but still used in code - they will be removed later._
